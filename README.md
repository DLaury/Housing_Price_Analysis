# Housing_Price_Analysis\
Our team set out to provide a detailed analysis on the prediction of sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa by using datasets from Kaggle to analyze features and predict pricing of houses. The data sets can be found on our site and here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.
Our team decided to look into trying to predict the sale price of houses based on feature prediction. We chose this question because we wanted to know what it is was that drove a person to pay more or less for a house in a given area. Was it the number of bedrooms, baths, or perhaps the number of cars that could fit in the garage?



Some people have an intuitive feel of the value of a house, and use that knowledge to short the market and make a killing on the actual value of a house. But what if you could cut out the middle man and use an algorithm to determine the value of your house using a series of features run through a machine learning algorithm
