# Housing_Price_Analysis\
Our team set out to provide a detailed analysis on the prediction of sale prices of homes in Ames, Iowa by using datasets from Kaggle to analyze features and predict pricing of houses. The data sets can be found on our site and here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques.
By applying machine learning regression algorithms we were able to analyze the final sale price of homes against 12 individual features that showed the highest correlation with the final sale price.
